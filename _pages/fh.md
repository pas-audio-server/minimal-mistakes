# Sponsors sought
**WE NEED MORE DACS TESTING. WE ARE SEEKING SPONSORS TO PROVIDE ONE OR MORE OF THEIR USB DAC PRODUCTS. CREDIT AND PROMOTION WILL BE PROVIDED IN RETURN.**

pas is being developed on an [odroid-XU4](http://www.hardkernel.com/main/products/prdt_info.php?g_code=G143452239825).

The first USB DAC tried with pas was the [audioengine D3](http://audioengineusa.com/Store/D3-24-Bit-DAC) DAC.

Multi-stream support was first tested with a [DragonFly Black](http://www.audioquest.com/dragonfly-series/#features).

In addition to the above, two of <a href="http://www.fiio.net/en/products/27">these</a> are now in concurrent use along with the others:

The odroid-XU4 drives all four USB DACs (plus its built-in HDMI-based audio) without breaking stride. Here is a screenshot of pas driving five devices while also running the Linux command "htop." ![sshot]
